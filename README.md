## Features

- ✨ Scaffold a monorepo with ease
- 🧰 Monorepo plugins to use pre-configured common tooling
- ➕ Add workspaces on demand
- 🧬 Workspace templates for a library, React app, API or CLI
- ⚡ Extensible, bring your own plugins

## Why?

When I start a new project it often takes a couple of days before it becomes a
monorepo, at which point I find myself duplicating all sorts of configuration
and build scripts. This project aims to concentrate this struggle in one
opiniated tool, so you can scaffold monorepos and workspaces (a.k.a. monorepo
packages) quickly.

## Opiniated

While `mokr` is extensible and you can bring your own plugins, the core plugins
make some assumptions you may not agree with. If that's the case, this tool is
probably not for you. The defaults used by the various core plugins are
documented below and marked with a nerd-face emoji 🤓 so you should be able to
get a clear picture of what to expect when you decide to it.

## Prepare

You will need Node v16+ and Yarn v3+ in order to use `mokr`.

- Install Node with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)
  or using [nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall).
- Install Yarn v3 using these simple steps:
  ```bash
  corepack enable
  corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate
  ```

## How to use

Create a new monorepo:

```bash
yarn dlx mokr create my-repo
```

> ⚠️ Note that we use `yarn dlx mokr` to create a new monorepo. Once we are
> inside our monorepo, we can simply use `yarn mokr` to execute commands.

> 🤓 The monorepo is initiated with Yarn without Zero-Installs and in legacy
> `nodeLinker: node-modules` mode because a lot of packages are not yet
> compatible with PnP or require a workaround.

If you want additional tools installed at the monorepo level, add them with:

```bash
cd my-repo
yarn mokr use <plugins..>
```

For example:

```bash
yarn mokr use prettier husky lint-staged
```

> 💡 Note that some plugins depend on each other. For example, `lint-staged`
> will install a pre-commit hook which formats code if `prettier` and `husky`
> are installed. The order in which plugins are added does not matter.

See the section [plugins](#plugins) for a list of available options.

### Workspaces

Add a new shared library workspace:

```bash
yarn mokr add my-lib
```

Or use a workspace template (see below):

```bash
mokr add my-app --template <name>
```

## Core workspace templates

### `lib`

This is the default template (i.e. used when no template is specified). Your
package will be scaffolded with `typescript`.

### `cra`

Uses [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) to scaffold a React.js
app (web client)

### `adonis`

Uses
[create-adonis-ts-app](https://github.com/AdonisCommunity/create-adonis-ts-app)
to scaffold an Adonis app (API server)

### `bandersnatch`

Uses [bandersnatch](https://github.com/hongaar/bandersnatch) to scaffold a CLI
tool

## Core plugins

### `prettier`

This plugin sets up [Prettier](https://prettier.io) at the monorepo level.

> 🤓 Prettier is installed with this configuration:
>
> ```yaml
> proseWrap: always
> ```
>
> We only set this `proseWrap` override because we think markdown files should
> always be truncated to match whatever the `printWidth` setting is. Not having
> to do this manually makes writing markdown files so much easier!

### `jest`

This plugin sets up [Jest](https://jestjs.io) at the workspace level.

### `github-actions`

This plugin sets up [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) at the
monorepo level.

### `devcontainer`

This plugin sets up [devcontainer](https://containers.dev) configuration at the
monorepo level.

### `husky`

This plugin sets up [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) at the monorepo
level.

### `lint-staged`

This plugin sets up [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) at the
monorepo level.

If you have the `prettier` plugin installed, this will setup a task to format
staged files using `prettier --write --ignore-unknown`.

If you have the `husky` plugin installed, this will setup a pre-commit hook to
run `yarn lint-staged`.

## Roadmap

- Support for `swc`/`esbuild`
- A compat lib (which builds cjs and mjs targets)
- Support for BYO plugins/templates
- Remove plugins

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome!

## Development

To run the `mokr` CLI from source, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

Note that you can create a new monorepo for testing purposes outside the current
working directory with:

```bash
yarn start create /path/to/my-repo
```
